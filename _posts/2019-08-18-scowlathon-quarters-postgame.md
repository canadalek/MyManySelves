# The Great Galactic Scowlathon Quarter-Final Post Game Analysis
Sixteen of our heroes in a foul mood entered the [competition]({% post_url 2019-08-17-scowlathon %}), and now only *four remain!* You chose **Kernel Kira Nerice, Chief Miles O'Brien, Commander Data** and **Garek***, just Garek. See below for the full results. 

Notable results:

- **Kira's Scowl** got off to a strong start and managed to hold on despite a late strong showing from **Tuvok's eyebrow raise**. I was dissapointed **Tilley's open mouthed shock** didn't make the cut, but I can accept it.
- **O'Brien's dismissive guff** was meant to be "guffaw" but the text limits cut me off. That didn't stop the Chief though, he was in a close competition with **The Doctor's furled brow** but I guess hologram-human equality still has a ways to go. Or maybe just everybody like the Chief. **Riker saying "damn"** made a surpisingly strong showing.
- **Jadzia's sad sigh** of judgement made a strong showing, numerically beating the winners of the previous two rounds, but as we got more respondants it became harder to eke out a win. This is especially true when faced with **Data tilting his head at you** when you say something dumb, which is, you know, a lot by Data's standards.
- (*) As of press time, we are still waiting on the results of the fourth round but it looks like **Garek's knowing nod** is running away with the show. He already has as many votes numerically as Data, easily beating **Janeway's smirk** which performed weaker than I had expected, nothing would wither my confidence more than Captain Janeway being dissapointed in me. Interestingly **Worf's growl** and **Saru's click of judgement** are neck-and-neck for third place.

See you [tomorrow with with the final results and the setup for the semi-finals]({% post_url 2019-08-22-scowlathon2 %}).
