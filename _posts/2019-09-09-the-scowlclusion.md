# The Scowlclusion
This post will be short and deadly, just like fantastic, withering scowl of judgement of **Kernal Kira Nerice**.

In hindsight, it's obvious isn't it, who could compete? I don't know why I didn't rig the odds more against her, I guess I'm just a soft-hearted Ferengi after all.

Thanks for playing along, you can see the whole series at the [#scowlathon](/archive.html?tag=scowlathon) tag.
