I'm not much of a gambler overall, but when I'm Quark, I'll bet on anything. So polls are a good way to generate something to bet on, and you can trust me, I'm *completely* impartial as to who wins these:

  - [Post-game Analysis]({% post_url 2019-08-18-scowlathon-quarters-postgame %})
  
  - [The Semifinals]({% post_url 2019-08-22-scowlathon2 %})
