*Waiter:* Here’s your soufflé, umm, sir.

*Customer:* Are you certain there is no chicken in this meal?

*Waiter:* Sure, no chicken.

*Perfectly Normal Customer:* You must be completely certain, I cannot eat chicken, for religious reasons. I’m Hindu.

*Waiter:* Ha, I thought Hindus couldn’t eat beef.

*Perfectly Normal Human Customer:* That is correct, I meant I am kosher.

*Waiter:* Ummm, that’s pork.
