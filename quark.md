# Quark

I'm not much of a gambler overall, but when I'm Quark, I'll bet on anything. So polls are a good way to generate something to bet on, and you can trust me, I'm *completely* impartial as to who wins these:

- [The Great Galactic Scowlathon! (Quarter-Finals)]({% post_url 2019-08-17-scowlathon %})
  
  - [Post-game Analysis]({% post_url 2019-08-18-scowlathon-quarters-postgame %})
  
  - [The Semifinals]({% post_url 2019-08-22-scowlathon2 %})
  
  - [Semifinals Update]({% post_url 2019-08-24-semifinalsupdate%})

  - [The Finals]({% post_url 2019-09-04-scowlathonfinals%})
	- [The Scowlclusion]({% post_url 2019-09-09-the-scowlclusion%})
