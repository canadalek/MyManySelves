  Warning Humans and Daleks, spoilahs ahead. I’m watching the latest pair of episodes finally, responding here offline as I watch. Then I’ll post later so I don’t get the reactions from Twitter to spoil. Not that you’d do that loyal reader.

### The Dalek Invasion

Osgoode is really one of my favourite characters who’s come up in the past few years. She represents all of fandom and nerds and kicks as while doing it. So her death in the season finale last year was painful. I had heard the actress was back but I assumed she’d be a zygon. And now I’m trying to deal with *two Osgoodes*. I’m not doing very well.

Oh, and Osgoode-Left is wearing a question mark shirt from a different old Doctor. The 7th? So good. I’m going to guess she’s the Zygon, but that’s too easy isn’t it Moffat?

**What is the Osgoode box? **I’ve been paying attention but I can’t see it. I love when that happens. Oh, they’re going to keep the whole Osgoode death thing vague. Great, we’ll see how long that lasts.

#### Tumbleweed.

America is covered in them. I think Kate should have a bit more support. Maybe she did.


> I don’t answer that question. I am the peace. -OsgoodeGiven the way Osgoode is operating, and some others, it seems that the new type of Zygon really absorbs the human entity they are copying. So maybe the majority of the Zygons really do just want to live in peace in their human lives.

#### Hybrids

Ok, so maybe I’m behind but I haven’t been reading Doctor Who gossip or listening to Reality Bomb so sue me. The theme this season seems to be hybrids. Has *every* episode had a hybrid storyline? The Dalek-humans, the viking-maya, now human-zygon. Missy said something about hybrids too. Is it a message being sent to the Doctor or is the universe just getting all hybridy? I had an idea that the answer for Clara’s easy integration into the Dalek was that she is some kind of hybrid, but only Missy knows it.

We’ll see.

#### Clara

Oh my. We’ve never had Clara being the bad one before. This will be fun. She’d make a good villian. I hope the other unit woman isn’t dead.

Why is Clara being kept alive if the copy is active? Too much information to absorb? Also, how did the Indian kid know it wasn’t his parents, he knew right away. Given the

### The Inversion

I’m going to try not to think about what the title means.

Oh that speech:


> “It’s not a game Kate. This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought, right there in front of you.
> “Because it’s always the same. When you fire that first shot no matter how right you feel, you have no ideas who’s going to die! You don’t know whose children are going to scream and burn. How many hearts will be broken!
> “How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does what they were always going to have to do from the very beginning…
> “SIT DOWN AND TALK!”Great pair of episodes.
