# Final Round of the Great Galactic Scowlathon
    It's been a long road...
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    ...getting from...

### Sorry!

Thank you for your patience my wonderful customers, I was unavoidably delayed. Can you believe the Breen were holding me hostage on trumped up charges of smuggling Andorian Rye Wine through the badlands? 

**Me!** *Outrageous.*

Anyways...the wait is over, the final stage of **The Great Galactic Scowlathon** is here!

As I predicted in the [Semifinals Update]({% post_url 2019-08-24-semifinalsupdate%}) *Kira* did in fact trounce *Data* and in fact almost got more vote total than the *Chief* and *Garek* combined in their own competition. But Garek came out on top, which is how he prefers it of course...and now he has to face the Kernel himself. I make no predictions, but I will take bets on both sides of course.
